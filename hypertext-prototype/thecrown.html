            <p> I'm obsessed with <a href ="matter.html">some objects.</a> Their shape, color, texture, their temperature, the moments they prompted: <a href="desobediencia.html"> working women supporting each other</a> or brigning <a href="cachipay.html">together people to eat.</a> And there's other type of objects. Those that we might encounter in digital space, which I can't stop thinking about. Some reinforce logics of colonialism by inscribing their symbolism in websites and online documents. <a href="pensamientos.html">Those SVG files of crowns, royality, gems and whatnot -treated as program-objects through folds/lines of code</a> execute another kind of power and propagate other forms of (subtle?) systematic violences just as their homologous physical objects did in the past. Those also obsses me.</p>
