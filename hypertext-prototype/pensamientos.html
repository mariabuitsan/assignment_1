            <p> I'm obsessed with some objects. Things that remind me of <a href="cachipay.html">my grandmother.</a> The things she used to do, her agriculture, her everyday labor. <a href=cradleboard.html> What they meant and mean now.</a> Their shape, color, texture, their temperature, the moments they prompted: <a href="cradleboard.html"> working women supporting each other</a> <a href="cachipay.html">or brigning together people to eat.</a> Material feminism brings back our attention to our objects and their mass production in this comic-tragic capitalistic absurdity. But it also shines back the way we all (maybe) take refuge underneath textures, colors and folds and feel ordinary beauty while walking through our mountains of ENDLESS SHIT. But that shit can also glow and not behind shiny glasses with tag prices on them, but rather discarded and dirty-looking, unnoticed. There's other objects that occur in digital spaces and reinforce logics of colonialism by inscribing their symbolism in websites and online documents. <a href="thecrown.html">Those SVG files and whatnot, treated like objects through folds/lines of code</a> seem to create another power and propagate another form of (subtle?) systematic violence just as their homologous physical objects did in the past. Those also obsses me.</p>
